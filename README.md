# Deep Learning From Scratch

This repository contains a complete implementation of **deep learning concepts** built entirely **from scratch** without using Pytorch.  
The goal of this project is to **deeply understand** how neural networks and their components work under the hood by implementing everything using only basic Python and NumPy.
